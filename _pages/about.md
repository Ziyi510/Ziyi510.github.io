Iâ€™m a final-year undergraduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

My research interests lie in AI and machine learning, with a focus on Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models.

I participated in the Undergraduate Research Experience on Campus (URECA) at NTU under the supervision of Prof. Chen Lihui.

In Spring 2025, I spent a semester on exchange at Virginia Tech.

I'm currently a research intern at Rice University, working with Dr. Xia (Ben) Hu and Dr. Guanchu Wang.

You may refer to my [CV](/files/CV.pdf) for more details.
